# Doge

This is the Doge Game.

Collect the Carrots to earn points and dodge the spikes and the moving chocolates on the map to avoid death! You may jump over obstacles
and enemies but you are able to shoot enemies down with your tennis balls. 

There are hidden checkpoints on the map so once you hit them, if you die you can respawn to that point! Don't fall off the map because
that will be sure to have you respawn as well!

The controls for the game are as followed:
  
  w -> jump
  w again -> double jump
  
  a -> move left
  
  d -> move right
  
  ENTER key -> shoot tennis balls


Enjoy
